<h2>Title of the project</h2>
    Never-stopping eyes
<br>
<h2>Description</h2>
    This project, mostly powered by CSS, consists of a pair of eyes that follow the cursor everywhere on the browser window.
<br>
<h2>Installation</h2>
    In order to run the program, all the files need to be downloaded into the same folder, keeping each file name and its extension intact. With the files in place, a simple drag-n-drop of the index.html file into a chromium-based browser will load it.
<br>
<h2>Usage</h2>
    After properly loading the file, there's nothing to click on. The eyes will follow the cursor non-stop as long as it stays within the browser window.
